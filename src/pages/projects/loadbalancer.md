# About This Project

This load balancer implementation was built to handle high-traffic distributed systems efficiently. It features intelligent routing algorithms and health monitoring to ensure optimal performance and reliability.

## Key Features

- Round-robin and weighted round-robin algorithms
- Health check monitoring
- Session persistence
- SSL termination
- Real-time metrics and monitoring

## Architecture

Built with Go for high performance and concurrency, the load balancer uses Docker for containerization and integrates with Nginx for additional routing capabilities. The system is designed to handle thousands of concurrent connections with minimal latency.

## Performance

The load balancer successfully handles over 10,000 concurrent connections with sub-millisecond response times, making it suitable for high-traffic production environments.
